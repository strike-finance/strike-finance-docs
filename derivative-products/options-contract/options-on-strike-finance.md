# Options On Strike Finance

Options on Strike Finance must have a stable coin in one side of the contract. For a put options, the assets must be bought with a stablecoin and for call options the assets must be sold for stablecoins.



Strike finance allows you to create an option and sell it to other traders.\
Based on whatever option you choose, you will need to lock up the assets on the platform. You can cancel your option and get your assets back if nobody has bought it, however if someone has bought your options, you asset will not be able to be retrieved back. However if the option has expired and the current holder has not excercised the option, you can get your assets back.&#x20;

\
Typical traders will buy a call option when they think an asset will go up and a put option when an asset will go down. Someone creating an option will do the opposite. \
\
If the issuer of the option thinks an asset will go up in value they will create a put option. If their assumptions are correct, they will be able to sell the options at a high price, while getting all of their assets back. The holder thinking the options will go down was wrong, and therefore it would be unprofitable for them to excersie the option.
