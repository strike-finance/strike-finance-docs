# Options Contract

Options contract allows traders to buy or sell an asset before a specified date but not an obligation. In an options contract, there are puts and call options. A put option allows the holder to sell an asset at a predetermined price and a call option allows the holder to buy an asset at a predetermined price.&#x20;



### Put Option

A put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a specific period. Traders purchase put options when they anticipate that the price of the underlying asset will decline. By holding a put option, they can sell the asset at a higher price than its market value, thereby making a profit.

#### Put Option Summary&#x20;

* **Hedge**: Protects against a decline in the price of an asset
* **Holder's Right**: The holder has the right to sell the asset at the strike price
* **Profit Scenario**: If the market price of the asset falls below the strike price, the holder can sell the asset at the higher strike price and buy it back at the lower market price, profiting from the difference

### Call Option

A call option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a predetermined price (the strike price) within a specific period. Traders purchase call options when they expect the price of the underlying asset to rise. By holding a call option, they can buy the asset at a lower price than its market value, thereby making a profit.

#### Call Option Summary&#x20;

* **Hedge**: Capitalizes on an anticipated increase in the price of an asset
* **Holder's Right**: The holder has the right to buy the asset at the strike price
* **Profit Scenario**: If the market price of the asset rises above the strike price, the holder can buy the asset at the lower strike price and sell it at the higher market price, profiting from the difference
