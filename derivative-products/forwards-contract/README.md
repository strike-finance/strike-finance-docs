# Forwards Contract

### Introduction to Forward Contracts

A forward contract is a financial agreement between two parties to exchange specific assets at a predetermined date in the future at a price agreed upon today.&#x20;

### Speculation

Forward contracts can also be used for speculative purposes, where parties bet on the future price of the underlying asset. This is seen as a bet between two parties regarding future price movements:

* **Long Party**: Agrees to buy the asset in the future at the agreed-upon price. Benefits if the asset's price rises above the agreed price by the settlement date.
* **Short Party**: Agrees to sell the asset at the agreed-upon price. Benefits if the asset's price falls below the agreed price by the settlement date.
