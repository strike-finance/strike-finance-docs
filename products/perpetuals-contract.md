# Perpetual Contract

Directionals contract is a first of its kind derivatives product developed by Strike Finance. It allows traders to take either a long or short position on an asset. At the end of a funding period, the asset's price at the start and end of the period is compared. The losing side compensates the winning side based on the price difference.

#### Example

The funding period begins with ADA at $1.00 and ends at $1.10, short sellers must surrender 10% of their initial position. The earnings are distributed evenly among the long sellers, proportional to their positions relative to the total positions.



### Funding Periods&#x20;

A new funding period starts every 3 minutes. The first 2minutes of each period allow traders to enter or exit positions. From 1.5 and 2 minutes after the funding period starts a premium is charged for entering or exiting positions. No positions can be entered or exited after 2 minutes
