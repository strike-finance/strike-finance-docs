# Forwards Contract

A forward contract is a binding agreement in which two parties agree to exchange specific assets on a future date at a price established when forming the contract.

### Speculation

Forward contracts can also be used for speculative purposes, where two parties bet on the future price of the underlying asset:

* **Long Party**: Agrees to buy the asset in the future at the agreed-upon price. Benefits if the asset's price rises above the agreed price by the settlement date.
* **Short Party**: Agrees to sell the asset at the agreed-upon price. Benefits if the asset's price falls below the agreed price by the settlement date.

### Binding Agreement

Unlike option contracts, where exercising the contract is optional, a forward contract's exchange of assets is mandatory. The transaction will occur on the specified date in the contract, regardless of the current market price of the asset at that time.
