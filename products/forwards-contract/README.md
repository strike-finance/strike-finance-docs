A forward contract is a binding agreement in which two parties agree to exchange specific assets on a future date at a price established when forming the contract.

### Binding Agreement

Unlike option contracts, where exercising the contract is optional, a forward contract's exchange of assets is mandatory. The transaction will occur on the specified date in the contract, regardless of the current market price of the asset at that time.

### Long Position

* **Party's Obligation**: The long party is obligated to buy the asset at the agreed-upon price on the settlement date
* **Profit Scenario**: If the market price of the asset rises above the agreed-upon price, the long party can buy the asset at the lower agreed price and sell it at the higher market price, profiting from the difference
* **Example**: A trader enters a forward contract to buy 1 ADA at $1 in one month. After a month, ADA rises to $1.5. The trader buys 1 ADA for $1 as per the contract, which is $0.5 lower than the current market price, earning a profit of $0.5.

### Short Position

* **Party's Obligation**: The short party is obligated to sell the asset at the agreed-upon price on the settlement date
* **Profit Scenario**: If the market price of the asset falls below the agreed-upon price, the short party can buy the asset at the lower market price and sell it at the higher agreed price, profiting from the difference
* **Example**: A trader enters a forward contract to sell 1 ADA at $1 in one month. After a month, ADA drops to $0.5. The trader buys 1 ADA at the market price of $0.5 and sells it for $1 as per the contract, earning a profit of $0.5.
