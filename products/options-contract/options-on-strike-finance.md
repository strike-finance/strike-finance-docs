### Option Issuers

Traders buy call options if they expect an asset's price to rise, and put options if they expect it to fall. Option issuers take the opposite position. If an issuer expects an asset's price to rise, they will issue a put option. The rationale is that if the asset's value increases, put option buyers are unlikely to exercise the contract as it would be unprofitable. This allows the issuer to sell option contracts without giving up their assets.

**EXAMPLE**: An issuer creates a put option that gives the right to sell 100 ADA at a strike price of $0.40 per ADA, with an expiration date set one month from now. The issuer offers this option for sale at a premium of $10 for the entire contract.

A trader, anticipating a drop in ADA's price over the next month, purchases this put option for $10. The issuer immediately pockets this $10 premium without having to give up any assets in the process.

Sometimes later, ADA is trading at $0.50 per coin in the market. At this point, the option holder has no incentive to exercise the contract. They have the right to sell ADA at $0.40 per coin, but they could sell it on the open market for $0.50 per coin instead. Exercising the option would result in a loss of $0.10 per ADA.

The trader still hopes the price will fall below $0.40 before the option expires, which would make it profitable to exercise. If the price doesn't drop below $0.40 by the expiration date, the option will likely expire worthless. In this case, the issuer keeps the $10 premium as profit, while the trader loses their $10 investment.

### Commissions

The issuer of an option contract can set a commission on the contract they created. This commission allows the issuer to earn a percentage of the sale price each time the contract is bought or traded. This creates an ongoing revenue stream for the issuer, even after the initial sale of the contract. Importantly, even if the option contract becomes profitable for the holder when executed, the potential loss for the issuer can be offset by the commission. This mechanism helps balance the risk and reward for option issuers.

### Stablecoins

All options on Strike Finance must involve a stablecoin on at least one side of the contract:

* For put options, assets must be bought with a stablecoin.
* For call options, assets must be sold for stablecoins.

Using stablecoins as the base currency for these contracts helps reduce overall volatility. Without a stablecoin component, both sides of the contract would be subject to price fluctuations, making it more difficult for traders to assess risk and potential returns.

### Bids

Traders can place bids on available contracts if they believe the current asking price is too high.&#x20;
