# Options On Strike Finance

Options contracts on Strike Finance are created by traders and can be bought and resold continuously.&#x20;

### Issuers

Traders buy call options if they expect an asset's price to rise, and put options if they expect it to fall. Option issuers take the opposite position. If an issuer expects an asset's price to rise, they will issue a put option. The rationale is that if the asset's value increases, put option buyers are unlikely to exercise the contract as it would be unprofitable. This allows the issuer to sell option contracts without giving up their assets.

### Commissions

The issuer of an option contract can set a commission on the contract they created. This commission allows the issuer to earn a percentage of the sale price each time the contract is bought or traded. This creates an ongoing revenue stream for the issuer, even after the initial sale of the contract. Importantly, even if the option contract becomes profitable for the holder when executed, the potential loss for the issuer can be offset by the commission. This mechanism helps balance the risk and reward for option issuers.

### Stablecoins

All options on Strike Finance must involve a stablecoin on at least one side of the contract:

* For put options, assets must be bought with a stablecoin.
* For call options, assets must be sold for stablecoins.

Using stablecoins as the base currency for these contracts helps reduce overall volatility. Without a stablecoin component, both sides of the contract would be subject to price fluctuations, making it more difficult for traders to assess risk and potential returns.

### Bids

Traders can place bids on available contracts if they believe the current asking price is too high.
