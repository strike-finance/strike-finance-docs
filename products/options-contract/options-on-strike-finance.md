# Options On Strike Finance

### Options Requirements

Options on Strike Finance must involve a stablecoin on at least one side of the contract. For put options, the assets must be bought with a stablecoin, while for call options, the assets must be sold for stablecoins. Having two volatile assets makes it difficult for traders to decide whether to enter a contract.

### Marketplace

Strike Finance allows you to create an option and sell it to other traders. Based on the option you choose, you will need to lock up the assets on the platform. You can cancel your option and get your assets back if nobody has bought it. However, if someone has bought your option, your asset cannot be retrieved. After the option has expired and the current holder has not exercised it, you can get your assets back.

Typical traders will buy a call option when they think an asset will go up and a put option when they think an asset will go down. Someone creating an option will do the opposite.

If the issuer of the option thinks an asset will go up in value, they will create a put option. If their assumptions are correct, they will be able to sell the options at a high price while getting all of their assets back. The holder, thinking the options will go down, was wrong, and therefore it would be unprofitable for them to exercise the option.
